Create process with TCP/UDP server
Finish ploting routines
Online plotting in separate process
Finish gyems and tmotor classes create a rep 
Make a udp server in separate process
Implement simple state machine

Make  prototype for control routines
	- udp/tcp server to communicate with raspberry/nucleo
	- udp/tcp client on raspbery  
	- controller process (device) 
	- sensing process (device)
	- observer process (device)
	- online plotter/printer (device)
	- create several controllers to test (PD, Feedback Linearization, Robust, Adaptive)
	- interpolation for the desired trajectory?


Decide on structure of setups (abstaract class), what ae the basic components.
	- actuators
	- sensors 
	- controllers 

Implement following setups.

General:
	- pendulum
	- remotely driven 2 link
TSA
	- pushing linear
	- linear antagonist
	- rotational joint 

Underactuated
	- cart pole
	- reaction wheel pendulum
